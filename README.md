# Learning Object 3: Trolley Problem Moral Simulator

**Author:** Hashim Shahzad Khan  
**Audience:** General learners (teens-adults) with no prior philosophy background.

## Overview
An interactive, text-based simulator that guides you through classic trolley dilemmas to show why morality cannot be reduced to counting lives. After each decision, the program frames your action through utilitarian, deontological, and intuition-based lenses and invites you to reflect on how uncomfortable the choice felt.

## Learning Goals
- Understand why trolley problems reveal the limits of purely numbers-based moral reasoning.
- Contrast act utilitarianism with deontological constraints (Kant, Thomson, rights-based views).
- Explore how intention, agency, doing vs allowing, and the doctrine of double effect shape moral judgment.

## Features
- Adjustable text pacing (`cinematic`, `standard`, or `instant`) to fit your reading style.
- Four scenario types: classic switch, footbridge push, autonomous vehicle, and an equal-numbers dilemma.
- Automatic philosophical evaluation written in the key vocabulary from the course.
- Optional discomfort ratings to log the emotional weight of each dilemma.
- Session summary that reports totals saved/killed and highlights your most uncomfortable scenario.

## Running the Simulator
```bash
python --version  # 3.10+ recommended
python main.py
```

Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on macOS) at any time to exit gracefully. No additional dependencies are required beyond the Python standard library.
